In this R Markdown file, we will provide a template for the DARE-Newcrest data challenge. The main steps covered here will be:

- Load the data
- Provide an overview of what is in the data
- Provide an example of a terribly performing baseline model
- Provide functions to quantify model predictive performance

## Imports and settings
Everything we need to get started.
